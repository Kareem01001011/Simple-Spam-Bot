# Simple Spam Bot

A Simple and easy way to be the most hated person between your friends, All you have to do is spam the group chat 
using this bot until you get kicked...

Please don't bully me if my readme file does not look that professional, it's my first time writing a readme.

## NOTE

This is the beta version of this project, Do not expect it to be polished/fully featured/not buggy, I'm trying to fix as much bugs as I can and I'll be trying to add more features.

## How it works

Basically, the bot takes the text you entered in the first input and takes the number you entered in the second input and uses it 
to know how many times you want to type the text you entered, and then it types it for you. Simple as that!

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and make sure it's added to PATH, 
Then open the Command Prompt and type this command:
```batch
pip install ttkthemes pyautogui
```
That's it. you're done!
